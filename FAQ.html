                <p><strong>What are the risks in investing in equities?</strong></p>
                <p>An equity investment does carry certain risks. Some are related to the particular stock including the company’s business prospects, also known as unsystematic risk. However, some risks are common to all stocks i.e. market risks and macro-economic risks, which are also known as systematic risk. Investors can almost entirely eliminate unsystematic risk by a diversification strategy which will reduce his exposure to a particular sector or stock.</p>

                <br>
               
                <p><strong>How to pick a stock?</strong></p>
                <p>By tracking and analyzing stocks, you can spot and cash-in on opportunities as and when they emerge which will maximize your profitability. While relying on advice of brokers and market experts should form the basis for your selection process, due consideration must be given to your investment objective, risk profile and the stock fundamentals. Fundamental analysis will tell you whether a stock is currently undervalued, correctly priced or overvalued, thereby enabling you to choose the scrip that has a scope of appreciation. An investor must not hesitate to rein his equity portfolio if the company’s business prospects deteriorate or investors’ circumstances or objectives change.</p>

                <p><strong>How is income from equity investing taxed?</strong></p>
                <p>Dividends received are not taxable in the hands of shareholders. However, short-term gains from equity investment attract a capital gains tax. If an investor gains from selling equity shares that were bought and sold within a period of less than one year, he is liable to pay short-term capital gain tax. The rate of taxable in this case is 11.22% (i.e. 10% tax + 2% education cess + 10% surcharge, if applicable). However, in case of gains from shares sold after 1 year from date of purchase, there is no tax.Further, an investor is obligated to pay a Service Tax at the rate of 12.24% on the brokerage charges that he pays. In addition, a Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on certain types of sale and purchase transactions of shares is levied. The STT rate for delivery-based transactions is 0.125% of the transaction value for both buyers and sellers. For non-delivery based transactions, STT of 0.025 per cent of the transaction value is payable.</p>
